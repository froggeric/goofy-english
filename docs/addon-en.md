Several options are available. The choice depends on which station you need:
- [the-radio](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/35)
- [pcradio](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/60)
- [AudioAddict](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/57) (di.fm and others)
- [Radio Paradise](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=715234&view=findpost&p=105313450)

> If you didn't find the desired station or want another source, write [on the forum](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions)

### Recommendations from the past

For Last.fm users. The [thread](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/91) describes an example of using the function [getCustomTop](/reference-en/lastfm?id=getcustomtop), which creates a playlist `Memory Rut`, consisting of good, but forgotten tracks.

### Skips listening

[This method](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/53) is based on reading files that Spotify creates locally on the device. Thus providing access to tracks that have been quickly skipped and did not get into the visibility zone [main mechanism for collecting playback history](/details?id=Playback-history). 

### New releases

Imports tracks of a selected genre from the site [Every Noise](https://everynoise.com/new_releases_by_genre.cgi). Description [in the thread](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/36).

> To get releases of tracked artists, use the function [getArtistsTracks](/reference-en/source?id=getartiststracks) with the `release_date` parameter

### Other

Even more examples are described [on the forum](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions) in the category _personal experience_.
